# Data Structures and Applications - CS-451
Umaer Basha Institute of Information Technology - UoK

## Overview

This repository contains theory and practical implementations of Data Structures and Application as per University Course

## Learning Progress

#### 1. Searching and Sorting
- [**Binary Search (Single)**](./Search%20and%20Sort/Binary%20Search/binarySearch.cpp) - Implementation of Binary Search for Single element
- [**Binary Search (Multiple)**](./Search%20and%20Sort/Binary%20Search/binarySearchMulti.cpp) - Implementation of Binary Search for Repeated element
- [**Linear Search (Single)**](./Search%20and%20Sort/Linear%20Search/linearSearch.cpp) - Implementation of linear Search for Single element
- [**Linear Search (Multiple)**](./Search%20and%20Sort/Linear%20Search/linearSearchMultiple.cpp) - Implementation of Linear Search for Repeated element

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- Basic understanding of C++ programming
- Command line/terminal access

### Running the Code
1. Clone this repository:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shahaam-Sid/CS-451-Sem-3.git
   cd CS-451-Sem-3
```

2. Navigate to the desired algorithm directory:
```bash
   cd "Search and Sort/Binary Search"
```

3. Compile the C++ file:
```bash
   g++ binarySearch.cpp -o binarySearch
```

4. Run the executable:
```bash
   ./binarySearch
```
